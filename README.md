# Tennis-ATP-data-analysis-with-python
Hello! dear reader!

This was my first python project so everyone can see how my projects evolve over time!

Here is a project I have been working on to develop my python skills and hopefully extract some valuable and interesting insights about a sport plenty of people like!

The insights are extracted from multiple datasets that were found on datahub.io (https://datahub.io/sports-data/atp-world-tour-tennis-data)!
Here the data exploration is performed on:
- match stats 
- player's rankings
- player's stats
- match results
- tournaments 

Thank you for your feedback!
